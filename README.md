# About Me

Greetings &#128075;

My name is Nikhil Seth _aka_ SNikhill.

I am a Front End Engineer by trade with a knack for
the Terminal and a love for the Open Source.

I have been professionally developing web for 4 years and have learnt from every
mistake that I made.

- *Current OS*: Exploring Arch Based Distributions

## A Consistent Learner

Over the years, I have gained a certain sophistication which enables me to keep
learning consistently and growing myself.

## A Voracious Reader

I once read that the Best Investment one can make is in oneself.

I actually decided to follow the same and choose books to be my source of
knowledge.

I have a tendency to collect inspiring quotes / excerpts from the books I read.
